# Track

Track things like:
1. Day rating (1-5)
2. *Effort*

## Usage 

```
track day set 3
```


## Why

I've tried Jim Collins day scoring appoach in the past where he scores his days between -2 to +2, but I wasn't as consistent as I wanted to be.

This is simpler and tailored.
Rate 1-5 vs. -2 to +2 for ease of cli passing
